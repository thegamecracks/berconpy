# berconpy

[![PyPI](https://img.shields.io/pypi/v/berconpy?label=View%20on%20pypi&style=flat-square)](https://pypi.org/project/berconpy/)
[![Docs](https://readthedocs.org/projects/berconpy/badge/?style=flat-square)](http://berconpy.readthedocs.io/)

An asynchronous Python wrapper over the [BattlEye RCON protocol][1].

## Usage with Arma Reforger

If you are only interested in RCON for Arma 3 / DayZ, you may safely ignore this section.

Currently, a preliminary rewrite of this library exists to provide some degree
of support for Arma Reforger. See issue [#7] for information on how to install it.
Note that the official documentation is not updated to cover this rewrite, so most
documented classes and methods will exist under different names.

[#7]: https://github.com/thegamecracks/berconpy/issues/7

## Features

- Easy to use event-based interface
- Automatic network loss recovery
- Included extension for using Arma-related commands

## Basic Usage

```py
import asyncio
import berconpy

client = berconpy.AsyncRCONClient()

IP = "XXX.XXX.XXX.XXX"
PORT = 9999
PASSWORD = "ASCII_PASSWORD"

@client.dispatch.on_login
async def on_login():
    print("We have logged in!")

async def main():
    async with client.connect(IP, PORT, PASSWORD):
        players = await client.send_command("players")
        print(players)

asyncio.run(main())
```

See the [documentation][2] for more details.
